            <h2>Survey Note: Comprehensive Analysis of Wolt Promo Code in Germany</h2>

            <h3>Background on Wolt</h3>
            <p>Wolt Enterprises Oy, trading as Wolt, is a Finnish food delivery company known for its platform that facilitates ordering food and merchandise from partner restaurants and stores. Acquired by DoorDash in May 2022, Wolt continues as a sub-brand in Europe and Asia, including Germany, where it operates in major cities. The service, founded in 2014, allows customers to order via apps (iOS and Android) or the website, with options for delivery or pickup by courier partners. Wolt also runs its own grocery stores, Wolt Market, enhancing its offerings.</p>
            <p>Research indicates Wolt's expansion to 23 countries and over 100 cities by 2020, partnering with 27,000 restaurants and retailers, showcasing its significant presence (<a href="https://explore.wolt.com/about">About Wolt</a>). In Germany, it covers cities like Berlin, Munich, and Hamburg, offering a diverse range of cuisines and ensuring efficient delivery, which is a key attraction for users.</p>
            <h3>Understanding the Promo Code "HKVG27U"</h3>
            <p>The user can use the promo code "HKVG27U" to earn 32 euros in total, with discounts of 4 euros off each of the first three orders and an additional 50% discount on the first two orders, with a maximum of 10 euros per order for those. This structure suggests a combination of fixed and percentage-based discounts.</p>
            <p>Initial research into Wolt's promo codes for Germany, via pages like <a href="https://life.wolt.com/en/deu/howto/wolt-promo-codes">Wolt Promo Codes</a>, revealed general information about discounts, such as 50% off the first two orders with a 10 euros cap per order for orders worth 13 euros or more.</p>
            <p>Searches for "wolt promo code HKVG27U" yielded specific mentions on platforms like Medium and GitHub, suggesting a 15 euros discount on the first order. This discrepancy indicates variability in promo code terms.</p>
            <h3>Discount Calculation and Stacking</h3>
            <p>To align with the description, let's calculate the potential savings:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>For the first two orders:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Assume an order value of 20 euros (to maximize the 50% discount).</li>
                        <li>50% off is 10 euros (capped at 10, as per the maximum discount amount).</li>
                        <li>Plus an additional 4 euros off, suggesting a total discount of 14 euros per order.</li>
                        <li>Total for two orders: 14 * 2 = 28 euros.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>For the third order:
                    <ul>
                        <li>4 euros off, so if the order is 20 euros, you pay 16 euros, discount is 4 euros.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
                <li>Total discount: 28 + 4 = 32 euros.</li>
            </ul>
            <p> Percentage discounts are applied first to the order total, then fixed discounts. For example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Order of 20 euros: 50% off is 10 euros, order cost becomes 10 euros, then 4 euros off makes it 6 euros paid, total discount 14 euros.</li>
                <li>This pattern holds for the first two orders, and the third order simply gets 4 euros off.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Given this, it seems likely the discounts can stack, but users should verify on the Wolt app, as terms may vary. The requirement for orders to be at least 13 euros for the 50% discount to apply, as seen in <a href="https://life.wolt.com/en/deu/howto/wolt-promo-codes">Wolt Promo Codes</a>, is crucial.</p>

            <h3>Usage Instructions</h3>
            <p>To use "HKVG27U":</p>
            <ol>
                <li>Download the Wolt app from the App Store or Google Play, or visit <a href="https://wolt.com/en/deu">wolt.com</a>.</li>
                <li>Sign up as a new user, providing email and phone details.</li>
                <li>During checkout or in the account settings, enter "HKVG27U" in the promo code field.</li>
                <li>Place orders ensuring the first two are at least 13 euros to qualify for the 50% discount, and note the fixed 4 euros will apply to the first three.</li>
            </ol>
            <h3>Additional Considerations</h3>
            <p>Wolt offers other promotions, such as referral bonuses (7 euros per friend's first three orders, as per <a href="https://life.wolt.com/en/deu/howto/wolt-promo-codes">Wolt Promo Codes</a>) and Wolt+ subscriptions for zero delivery fees (<a href="https://explore.wolt.com/en/deu/wolt-plus">Wolt+</a>). These can complement the promo code, but terms may prohibit combining offers, so check the fine print.</p>
            <p>The research also highlighted Wolt's sustainability focus and high courier satisfaction rates (91%, as per <a href="https://careers.wolt.com/en/story">Wolt Careers</a>), which might interest users looking for ethical delivery options. However, these are tangential to the promo code and not directly relevant to savings.</p>
